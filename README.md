# GifTastic

This is my entry for the GifTastic assignment at the UCLA Ext. Bootcamp.

## What it is

It is a simple gif search, either use the provided options, or add your own. You can also save your favorite gifs to view later.

## How I made it

I left a bit of the design aspect out, as this tries to display api usage and understanding. (I actually just fell a bit behind on homework).

There are a few features that aren't implemented yet:

* add more gifs of the same topic, pagination maybe?
* can't get the sticky footer to be responsive...

I used the giphy api to get the gif data, and jQuery to create the logic. The styling is done with Bootstrap.
